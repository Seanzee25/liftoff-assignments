## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a dispatching/work order management tool to enable a business to easily coordinate the creation, dispatching, and completion process of work orders in the environment of a mobile service business model.
The basis of my project stems from prior work history as a Locksmith for 5 years.
Likely, tools like this already exist to some extent. My goal is to provide a very limited, but concise feature set to enable the most simple interface possible for coordinating these tasks based on my experience in the field.

### Features
Creation of Business profile/account in order to manage your business, customers, work orders, and employees.
Roles in order to determine user functionality based on that role such as creating work orders being limited to a "dispatcher" role, and starting/completing work orders being limited to "technician" roles.
Searching capabilities with various filters allows easy access to your customer base as well as their past, present, and future work orders.
Google maps integration for easy viewing of pending work orders, allowing for simple route planning.
Administratively managing customer information and employee roles.

Possible stretch goals for the project could include:
Invoice generation/integration.
Tracking employee statistics regarding job time completion and generated revenue.
Tracking customer statistics such as work orders per month and monthly/annual revenue.

Much larger stretch goal that could be nice would be integration of an inventory management system to track parts possibly needed
for a job. Being able to see available inventory for work orders and easily generate a PO that is automatically sent to a distributor to order parts for jobs that are not in stock.
